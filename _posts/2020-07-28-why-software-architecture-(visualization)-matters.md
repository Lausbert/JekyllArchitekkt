So you have no idea about software architecture? Perfect. I need your help. I'm trying to figure out which of the two apps below is better structured. Watch the video to understand what we're talking about here. At the beginning, both display an introductory screen with the appicon. A screen with three turquoise bubbles follows. Everyone loves turquoise bubbles. And finally there is the last screen with an orange bubble. This navigation flow could represent any introduction to any app. In the real world, this could be all sorts of things that happen when you first open an app. A nice animation, short tutorials, asking for the push permission, the location permission or the phone number. In short any screen is possible. In order not to distract ourselves further (and because I already had the assets prepared for the main page), we stick to the appicon, the turquoise bubbles and the orange bubble. Did you see the video? Then you might ask yourself the following questions: How the hell should I use the video to decide which app is better structured? And can such a small useless program be structured differently well, i.e. better and worse? Regarding the first question: You are right there. Just keep reading. Regarding the second question: Definitely. Of course, the effects of poor architecture on a very small program are mostly not tragic. But all the big, impenetrable software hells that developers deal with in their everyday lives were once small, innocent programs. So again, just read on.
